TheThe Site Exit Manager pops up a special window on the event of website exit, trying to keep the visitor's attention.

== Description ==

[TheThe Site Exit Manager](http://thethefly.com/wp-plugins/thethe-site-exit-manager/ "TheThe Site Exit Manager") is a WordPress plugin that manages the event of website exit. Whenever a visitor tries to quit the website, this plugin pops up a special window with text to ask the visitor if he/she really wants to quit. While popping up this window, the plugin is basically loading a specified URL or WP page/post in the background (usually with a special offer to motivate the visitor to keep surfing the site). If this site exit manager is used wisely, it can help in increasing your sales letter or squeeze page conversion rate.

**TheThe Site Exit Manager** is natively created for WP 3.x. It has a standard installation with quick and easy settings. You can either set it up to work for the whole website or activate it just on a particular page (like your sales letter or squeeze page) via a shortcode. With this WP plugin, you can easily organize a sequence of offers to keep your customer. Browsers: Firefox, Chrome, IE, Safari (no Opera!).
